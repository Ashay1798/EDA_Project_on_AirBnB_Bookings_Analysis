Airbnb stands for "Air Bed And Breakfast", and it is an online service that lets property owners rent out their premises, houses, or places to travelers looking for a place to stay. The prices of Airbnb premises are comparatively cheaper than hotels and it allows the owner to fix the price of premises for the traveler.
